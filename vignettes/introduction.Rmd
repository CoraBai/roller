## Object Rolling

The package `"roller"` is a minimalistic simulation of rolling
an object with different sides and probability a given number of times, and to visualize the relative frequencies in graphs.


## Creating a `device`

The first step is to create a `"device"` object with the function `device()`:

```{r}
defaultdevice <- device()
defaultdevice
```

By default, `device()` creates a _fair_ device with standard sides `1`, representing head and `2`, representing tail and with probability values for each side of 0.5. This object is similiar to a coin. 

Now we can change the parameters from default to `sides` and `prob`:
make sure the sides and probability satisfy the respective requirements (ie: length sides should be larger than 1)

```{r}
loaded <- device(sides = c(1, 2), prob = c(0.8, 0.2))
loaded
```


## Rolling a device

Once you have defined a `"device"` object, you can use the function `roll()` to
_roll_ the device a given number of `times`. The output will be an object of class 
`"rolls"`

```{r}
roll100 <- roll(defaultdevice, times = 100)
roll100
```

The `summary.rolls()` function gives you a table of frequencies:
```{r}
summary.rolls(roll100)
```


## Plot of relative frequencies

You can use the function `plot()` to create a graphic with the relative 
frequencies of a series of rolling devices:

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(roll100)
```
